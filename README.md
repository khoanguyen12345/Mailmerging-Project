# Mailmerging-Project
This project aims to help the MUN team with mailmerging. It takes in a .csv file and outputs a .pdf that contains the mailmerged result of all the names in the .csv file. There are 3 modes for either nametags, certificates or labels.

How to use:
1. Insert .csv file
2. Enter in the fields of the user interface (use <> when mentioning fields in .csv file)
3. Press Browse and search for nametags/labels/certificates (samples included in localresources folder)
4. If font size or positioning needs to be changed, see new preview by pressing update preview button
5. Press Save As PDF
6. Look inside the folder containing app.py. The pdf should be there.

Notes:
- Still incomplete. Functions are all done but error-catching and bug-fixing will be implemented by the time the MUN conference comes around (by January 2022)
- Many thanks to official tkinter documentation, PIL documentation and StackOverflow for pointing me in the right direction!
